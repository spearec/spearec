### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recently graduated Computer Science & Sustainability dual major.
I'm excited about any opportunity to combine those two areas, such as one of my past projects, [Open Energy Dashboard](https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED)!

I have [another github](https://github.com/airom42) I use for hobby projects as well.
