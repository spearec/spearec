### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science & Sustainability dual major. I'm excited about any oppurtunity to combine those two things, such as one of my current projects, [Open Energy Dashboard](https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED)!

I have [another github](https://github.com/airom42) I use for hobby projects as well.
